<h3>🚀 About Me</h3>
🎓 My name is Will Weinel and I am a Web Developer who specializes in PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and Linux. I graduated from college in 2014 majoring in Computer Science where I took courses on Java, Python, Natural Language Processing, Computer Networks, and Database Design.
<br><br>
👨‍💻 I enjoy reading up on Open Source Projects and am always on YouTube learning about the latest in new technology and PC building.  
<br><br>
🎹 Outside the world of tech, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. This year I have started to learn piano which has always been a dream of mine. I can play Fur Elise by Mozart and Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven. Maybe one day I will be able to play Fantaisie Impromptu.
